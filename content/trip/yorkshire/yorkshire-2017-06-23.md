## Saturday

### Marble Steps: {{ DATE=2017-06-24; CAVE=Marble Steps; }}

Marble Steps was supposedly an old club classic that we seem to have forgotten about until quite recently. We had a trip there at the start of the year but I wasn't on it and due to, ahem, unforeseen circumstances they didn't have the rope to make it to the bottom. 

We barreled up to the water works and ground to a halt on the cobbled path just shy of the Turbary road. Changing was pleasant, a grade 1 summer change at most. Ben and I had both committed the aerial google maps view of the area to memory but from the parking spot you can see, up on the fell, the copse of trees that surround Marble Steps. On top of that the path is quite clear (almost excessively so) if you choose to follow it.

We walked up, following the Ireby group. They turned off too early, leading us into knee-deep grass and moss. The actual path is rather extravagant paving stones and so there's no advantage to cutting the corner as we accidental did. Evenutally we rejoined the actual path and soon approached Marble Steps. The entrance is a large gully with a small (probably sometimes large) stream entering from one side. 

We meandered down the dry side, finding some in-situ tat that got use almost all the way to the Gully Route pitch head. From the looks of the poorly hidden spade the rope goes as far as someones horrible dig. Ben started rigging the Gully route which drops straight of the edge of a ledge. I began rigging the Sidewinder route which involves rigging a traverse round to a window on the other side. It looks moderately indtimidating as the bolts ascend steeply up what looks to be a very slippery wall but once you're over there it turns out to be pretty easy.

Davey Dubz and Peter followed me into the window. Trailing the rope from the traverse I dropped a couple of short free climbable pitches to rejoin the small stream. Here we examined our rope. I decided that we definitely didn't have enough and that we should stop caving immediately. Peter said we should carry on anyway and it would work itself out. Peter turned out to be right.

The following pitch drops into the Main Chamber. A lovely 20m hang to a cute y-hang at the top of a slope. As you descend the slope the cieling comes down to meet you and there's some helpful bits of tat to deviate off. As I descended I could see Ben coming down the Gully route. It's a very sociable cave to rig! I landed in the main chamber a few minutes before Ben but waited and continued as a group.

A short pitch leads to the 'Lower Main Chamber' and from there a rifty passage leads off. Eventually you traverse over a small pit with the stream in and the next pit is Stink Pot. We had brought a 27m rope because our rigging guide suggested a 28m rope. A more recent rigging guide suggests 30m. Ben said he would rig conservatively.

I followed Ben down the first hang. The rope at the bottom leads into a traverse for the second hang. As I landed I shimmied right up to the bolt to see exactly how little rope we could get away with. Then as ben rigged below, I pulled the slack I'd created into the traverse line. Ben called up from below that he wasn't sure if we'd make it. I offered him an extra 3 meters and he agreed to make himself safe. I fed it through into the second hang. 

Ben had replaced a rebelay with a deviation to save rope, unfortunately this was still causing a big rub point because the passage doubles back on itself and the rope rubbed on the overhang as you descended under it. I replaced the deviation with my now patented 'rebelay' on a sling. It has all the advantages of a rebelay (when you weight it it doesn't cause the rope above to rub) and the advantages of a deviation (it moves so you can make the rebelay really tight and people can still lock off).

We were now at the entrance to the Intestines. Ben decided he wasn't feeling up to rigging it as he stared at the shrinking passage so I took over. The passage deteriotes into a sideways crawl but only for a body length or two. Just before the next pitch there is a convenient "rigger's chamber" with enough room to turn around and place the bag out of the way. The backup bolt is here. The CNCC rigging guide makes a big deal of the pitch head being a flat out crawl but in reality from the rigger's chamber its a body length, relatively spacious, sideways crawl. Leaving the bag behind I wiggled in head first to rig and then turned round and went feet first to descend. There's a really nice ledge to stand on so its not even a particularly awkward pitch head to pass.

The landing is a small chamber, the way on a low dampish crawl. The next pitch again is only a body length or so into the crawl but its important to note that the backup 'thread' that the rigging guide recommends is right at the start of the crawl as I found out whilst awkwardly wriggling backwards. This pith head is more spacious than the last and should present no trouble.

Landing once again in a small chamber the way on is down a tortuous streamway. A load of water pisses in at this point from cracks in the cieling but its easy to avoid. The final pitch is a trifle compared to the other and I found myself quickly at the bottom contemplating some grim options.

Two ways on the bottom, a low wet crawl in silt, or a jagged looking sideways crawl. I had a cheeky look in the sideways crawl to confirm it went and then waited for the others. When Davey Dubz arrived I dispatched him into the wet silty crawl even he was unwilling to go very far into it. Alex and Cecilia dropped in reporting that Ben and Peter had bailed at the top so as a four we continued into the sideways crawl.

It's awkward but soon improves to hands and knees. A junction appears. Davey Dubz took the low road and I took the high. My route led up and up. Holes in the floor allowed me to see Davey Dubz grovelling in the crawl. Eventually I came to a small, high aven which I assume is the Ninety. I climbed back down one of the floor holes in time to drop in in front of Cecilia. We crawled further eventually finding Davey Dubz inserting himself into a sump. Classic Davey Dubz. 

Finding the end of the cave quite dissapointing we began the journey out. Alex derigged all the way from the bottom and out Sidewinder. We met Ben and Peter in the main chamber. I took a photo, got to justify dragging the camera gear around. We swapped routes for the way out. The gully crew were quite keen as they claimed there was a dead sheep that they didnt want to see/smell again. The sheep didn't dissapoint. We first found its head, its bloated, maggoty, fungusy body was on a ledge 20m higher.

We were greeted by a wind swept fell on our arrival on the surface. A classic trip! I would definitely go back and I would defintely send other people to the bottom. The Intestines would make a nice confidence builder for someone that doesn't like tight pitch heads I think.

### Ireby Fell Cavern: {{ DATE=2017-06-24; CAVE=Ireby Fell Cavern; }}

Last caving trip of the academic year!  Yorkshire.  Threats and rumors of heavy downpours during Saturday were treated with due caution and suspicion (the weather outside was overcast, slightly breezy but warm). We somehow talked ourselves out of doing Penyghent for which we had the permit and followed a brilliant idea by Dr Jack to look at caves in the Marble Steps area. 

I’d only visited Large Pot, so learning new caves sounded enticing. When Dr Jack and Cecilia came back from their rope collection errand, they brought half whispered news of great trips to be had at the bottom of Ireby Fell Cavern. This suited me, so Dr Jack, Mr Jack, Stephanie and myself formed a crack team, intent on bottoming the pothole and looking at the extensions in the master cave. 

Before this trip, I’d only had one introduction to the vastness, complexity and magnificence of the cave networks under this part of the Yorkshire Dales.  Sure I knew about the 3 -county system, but in my mind, it boiled down to the large Easegill maze, and some small potholes connected in a long chain of sumps. Perhaps my previous experience in the Boxhead – Lost John’s system should have prepared me for this, but it was with no real expectations to find a truly amazing cave below Ireby that I joined the team. 

Following Jack’s lead, we made our way to the entrance shakehole, with its stream disappearing down boulder choked rifts and a concrete tube entrance. With my rope tacklesack in tow, I descended the boulder slope past a drippy aven to the first pitch and began rigging the drop. There was a ledge traverse and a further ‘Y’-hang to descend the second pitch, but I had been over-generous with the loops further up and found myself short of 2m of rope. Stephanie had got to the traverse by then, but I ascended back up and tightened the line and fed the extra rope through the ‘Y’-hang knot.  It reached, but only just.

The spray near the landing gave me more cause for concern however.  The active waterfall dropped to the right, with its water channeled by a small trench in the rock and splashed downwards merrily towards the third pitch. There, the profusion of P-bolts was disconcerting, but there were two clear options: a damp route, and an extra-damp route. This was lovely. 

The spray, the film of water on the walls, the small jets squirting from unlikely recesses, all combined to make progress unpleasant, but with each lunge for the next bolt, I carried on. The traverse continued at high level and I failed to notice an extra bolt around a corner, so my next ‘Y’-hang was rather far from the deviation bolt around the meander. Expedition rigging.  The deviation itself gave me some trouble, as it needed to be quite short to avoid rope rub.

 I dropped down, eager to get on with it, only to find myself in a draughty, boulder floored chamber, with spray drifting down at every possible angle.  Thankfully, the passage closed to a twisting meander with drier alcoves where I waited. One by one, Stephanie, Jack and Jack rejoined and we looked for the way down ‘Pussy pitch’.  Again, straightforward progress was thwarted by the amount of water going down the drop. There were in-situ traverse ropes, threaded through the rock, so we only rerigged the actual hang itself before carrying on. 

What followed was hundreds of metres of well-decorated streamway, a damp duck, more streamway until the nature of the passage changed entirely. The sinuosity decreased, and lots of calcite veins appeared on the wall. The rock looked quite shattered in places, and there were dark spots and networks of iron oxide deposition. 

Ahead, there was the rumble of a waterfall, so ‘Well pitch’ wasn’t far.  We spotted ‘Eurospeleo’ ropes, decided to use them, saving time and effort. The hang was dropping directly into what must generally be the dry route. Somehow, there was just enough water for a large jet to be projected right where we landed, thoroughly drenching both Stephanie and I. Around the corner however, I thought I saw our salvation: a dry hang, already pre-rigged too.  Was this another high-level traverse we could use to avoid the water on the way out? 

Since I was getting cold, I decided to ascend this rope, to check out where it rejoined the usual route, climbing high into the rift passage. To my surprise, the rope was one of the Misty Mountains Mud Miners, the anchors were a happy mix of hangers, D-rings and –this surprised me – unused IC anchors. Attached was a note ‘Use at your risk etc.…’ Ropes were leading off in all directions, higher up into the roof, along the traverse, back towards Well pitch. There must be a lot of cave passage joining in at this nexus. 

Back at the bottom, Stephanie had come down the water-filled shaft, and Mr Jack was preparing to descend. I was cold, Steph was shivering too, the pitch was full of water, and if it got any higher, it would make for an unpleasant and very cold ascent. I simply shouted for the Jacks to turn around, so we could climb back out and make other plans in the dry alcove just upstream. 

At the top, we were offered hot squash as a remedy against the dunking we had just got and after reporting on the water levels, decided to turn around there and make for the exit. On the walk upstream I warmed up, cooled down at the duck and warmed up again. Then, as we emerged into another section of walking stream passage near ‘Pussy Pitch’, we climbed into a dry, roof level passage, intent on exploring the various inlets at this higher level of the cave.

The ‘Glory Holes’ proved to be muddy but well decorated. A short section of phreatic roof passage also boasted a plethora of well-preserved crinoids and corals, and further on, a small stream passage – that is a near flat out damp crawl upstream – led off, which Jack investigated for as long as it took to find somewhere to turn around. This was fortunately, not too far in the passage, and came as a relief considering the foam that hung from the roof. This apparently goes on for quite a way and goes under the inspiring name of ‘True Grit’. 

We all had a go at inserting ourselves in desperate chattières, some being dug out crawls (again, one of them is part of a large loop route to Ireby II, providing a none-too pleasant connection with Jupiter Cavern), others tight drippy avens. Further upstream, there was another inlet, which quickly broke out into a large aven, a drier passage and a plethora of ropes and ladders leading up in every direction. I haven’t found these extensions on the newer Ireby surveys but one route is even P-bolted. Where do they lead?

With all these questions in mind, we climbed back out of Ireby Fell Cavern, emerging as sunlight dappled the valleys before us. We wandered off to Marble Steps to say hello to the other team, who were also on their way out, before finally walking back to the minibus. The rest was a blur of oily aioli madness and scrumptious oven baked potatoes. In the midst of it all lay a puzzle. Marble Steps had been bone dry all day, while Ireby responded to the little rain it had received in a sobering fashion. With the forecast of a dry night, plans were laid out for the bottoming of Ireby on the morrow.

### Ireby Fell Cavern: {{ DATE=2017-06-25; CAVE=Ireby Fell Cavern; }}

Lovely trip down Ireby on Sunday. Not sure why I've never been before. There's certainly a lot of good caving to be done. Tried out our filming kit for the first time. Some thoughts and ideas:

- Always have people walk on and off shot
- For interviews, have the interviewer on one side of the camera so that the interviewee is looking across the shot
- Tripod very useful (gorillapod)
- You can film on the way out and do every shot forwards and backwards to save time setting up shots
- Project Hyperion MK1 was dissapointing, probably due to undervolting the driver. MK1a should be brighter.
- Sony RX100II is a perfect UG filming camera
