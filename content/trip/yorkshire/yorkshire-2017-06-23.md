## Saturday

### Marble Steps: {{ DATE=2017-06-24; CAVE=Marble Steps; }}
### Ireby Fell Cavern: {{ DATE=2017-06-24; CAVE=Ireby Fell Cavern; }}
Last caving trip of the academic year!  Yorkshire.  Threats and rumours of heavy downpours during Saturday were treated with due caution and suspicion (the weather outside was overcast, slightly breezy but warm). We somehow talked ourselves out of doing Penyghent for which we had the permit and followed a brilliant idea by Dr Jack to look at caves in the Marble Steps area. 

I’d only visited Large Pot, so learning new caves sounded enticing. When Dr Jack and Cecilia came back from their rope collection errand, they brought half whispered news of great trips to be had at the bottom of Ireby Fell Cavern. This suited me, so Dr Jack, Mr Jack, Stephanie and myself formed a crack team, intent on bottoming the pothole and looking at the extensions in the master cave. 

Before this trip, I’d only had one introduction to the vastness, complexity and magnificence of the cave networks under this part of the Yorkshire Dales.  Sure I knew about the 3 -county system, but in my mind, it boiled down to the large Easegill maze, and some small potholes connected in a long chain of sumps. Perhaps my previous experience in the Boxhead – Lost John’s system should have prepared me for this, but it was with no real expectations to find a truly amazing cave below Ireby that I joined the team. 

Following Jack’s lead, we made our way to the entrance shakehole, with its stream disappearing down boulder choked rifts and a concrete tube entrance. With my rope tacklesack in tow, I descended the boulder slope past a drippy aven to the first pitch and began rigging the drop. There was a ledge traverse and a further ‘Y’-hang to descend the second pitch, but I had been over-generous with the loops further up and found myself short of 2m of rope. Stephanie had got to the traverse by then, but I ascended back up and tightened the line and fed the extra rope through the ‘Y’-hang knot.  It reached, but only just.

The spray near the landing gave me more cause for concern however.  The active waterfall dropped to the right, with its water channelled by a small trench in the rock and splashed downwards merrily towards the third pitch. There, the profusion of P-bolts was disconcerting, but there were two clear options: a damp route, and an extra-damp route. This was lovely. 

The spray, the film of water on the walls, the small jets squirting from unlikely recesses, all combined to make progress unpleasant, but with each lunge for the next bolt, I carried on. The traverse continued at high level and I failed to notice an extra bolt around a corner, so my next ‘Y’-hang was rather far from the deviation bolt around the meander. Expedition rigging.  The deviation itself gave me some trouble, as it needed to be quite short to avoid rope rub.

 I dropped down, eager to get on with it, only to find myself in a draughty, boulder floored chamber, with spray drifting down at every possible angle.  Thankfully, the passage closed to a twisting meander with drier alcoves where I waited. One by one, Stephanie, Jack and Jack rejoined and we looked for the way down ‘Pussy pitch’.  Again, straightforward progress was thwarted by the amount of water going down the drop. There were in-situ traverse ropes, threaded through the rock, so we only rerigged the actual hang itself before carrying on. 

What followed was hundreds of metres of well-decorated streamway, a damp duck, more streamway until the nature of the passage changed entirely. The sinuosity decreased, and lots of calcite veins appeared on the wall. The rock looked quite shattered in places, and there were dark spots and networks of iron oxide deposition. 

Ahead, there was the rumble of a waterfall, so ‘Well pitch’ wasn’t far.  We spotted ‘Eurospeleo’ ropes, decided to use them, saving time and effort. The hang was dropping directly into what must generally be the dry route. Somehow, there was just enough water for a large jet to be projected right where we landed, thoroughly drenching both Stephanie and I. Around the corner however, I thought I saw our salvation: a dry hang, already pre-rigged too.  Was this another high-level traverse we could use to avoid the water on the way out? 

Since I was getting cold, I decided to ascend this rope, to check out where it rejoined the usual route, climbing high into the rift passage. To my surprise, the rope was one of the Misty Mountains Mud Miners, the anchors were a happy mix of hangers, D-rings and –this surprised me – unused IC anchors. Attached was a note ‘Use at your risk etc.…’ Ropes were leading off in all directions, higher up into the roof, along the traverse, back towards Well pitch. There must be a lot of cave passage joining in at this nexus. 

Back at the bottom, Stephanie had come down the water-filled shaft, and Mr Jack was preparing to descend. I was cold, Steph was shivering too, the pitch was full of water, and if it got any higher, it would make for an unpleasant and very cold ascent. I simply shouted for the Jacks to turn around, so we could climb back out and make other plans in the dry alcove just upstream. 

At the top, we were offered hot squash as a remedy against the dunking we had just got and after reporting on the water levels, decided to turn around there and make for the exit. On the walk upstream I warmed up, cooled down at the duck and warmed up again. Then, as we emerged into another section of walking stream passage near ‘Pussy Pitch’, we climbed into a dry, roof level passage, intent on exploring the various inlets at this higher level of the cave.

The ‘Glory Holes’ proved to be muddy but well decorated. A short section of phreatic roof passage also boasted a plethora of well-preserved crinoids and corals, and further on, a small stream passage – that is a near flat out damp crawl upstream – led off, which Jack investigated for as long as it took to find somewhere to turn around. This was fortunately, not too far in the passage, and came as a relief considering the foam that hung from the roof. This apparently goes on for quite a way and goes under the inspiring name of ‘True Grit’. 

We all had a go at inserting ourselves in desperate chattières, some being dug out crawls (again, one of them is part of a large loop route to Ireby II, providing a none-too pleasant connection with Jupiter Cavern), others tight drippy avens. Further upstream, there was another inlet, which quickly broke out into a large aven, a drier passage and a plethora of ropes and ladders leading up in every direction. I haven’t found these extensions on the newer Ireby surveys but one route is even P-bolted. Where do they lead?

With all these questions in mind, we climbed back out of Ireby Fell Cavern, emerging as sunlight dappled the valleys before us. We wandered off to Marble Steps to say hello to the other team, who were also on their way out, before finally walking back to the minibus. The rest was a blur of oily aioli madness and scrumptious oven baked potatoes. In the midst of it all lay a puzzle. Marble Steps had been bone dry all day, while Ireby responded to the little rain it had received in a sobering fashion. With the forecast of a dry night, plans were laid out for the bottoming of Ireby on the morrow.
